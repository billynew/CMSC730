### Welcome!
This is a graduate-level, research-oriented course covering broad areas of interactive technology and [human-computer interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) (HCI) topics, _e.g._, [ubiquitous computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing), [wearables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_technology), [virtual/augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality%E2%80%93virtuality_continuum), [haptics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology), [tangible UIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangible_user_interface), [accessibility](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html), and [Interactive fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_modeling_and_fabrication).

The course consists of four modules. (1) **lectures**, through which we will examine major research topics in technical HCI; (2) **labs**, with which students will be equipped with a set of skills to make rapid and interactive physical prototypes, (3) **mini competition**, which require student dyad to use skills learned from the series of labs to design and build a rope climbing robot for a climbing competition, and (4) **semester-long project**, where students form a team of 3 to 4 and build a working prototype that solve one of the HCI/interation challenges.
